        <p>The goal of our project is to compare the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms for the detection of tropical cyclones/hurricanes to current objective detection methods. </p>
        <p>Current detection methods involve direct calculation of sea level pressure to determine whether or not a tropical cyclone exists. Our idea is to compare the effectiveness of a trained neural network in the detection of these events.</p>
        <p>The source of our data will be NASA EARTHDATA which contains all data collected by satellites available to the public. We will use an objective detector, TempestExtremes, to identify tropical cyclones within this data and use those as training points for our model.</p>
